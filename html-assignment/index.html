    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/hulk.jpg" alt="image of my cute dog hulk" />
    <p>My name is Yixin Li, I was born in China on 5<sup>th</sup> February 1999. After graduating from this program, I want to be a <abbr title="User Experience Designer">UX Designer</abbr>, and my final goal is to become a <mark>freelancer</mark> in this field. However, I always dream about having a pottery studio near the sea and watching the sunset while making pottery.</p>
    <p>I am a person who is very passionate about things that I am not familiar with or things I do not know. I love criminal novels and podcasts about true crime, <em>I wanted to be a forensic when I was a little kid</em>, but medicine is just too difficult for me to learn. I can also spend my whole day alone playing with Lego, baking etc.</p>
